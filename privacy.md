# Privacy Policy ‚Äì Whispr

**Effective Date:** 25th June 2025

At **Whispr**, your privacy comes first. Our goal is to provide a secure, private space for voice journaling ‚Äî without unnecessary data collection or cloud syncing. This policy explains what we do (and don‚Äôt do) with your data.

## 1. What We Collect

### üóÇÔ∏è Local Data (Stored on Your Device)
- All journal entries, audio recordings, and transcripts are **stored locally** on your device.
- **We cannot access, read, or listen to your entries.**
- Whispr does not upload your recordings or notes to any server or cloud service.

## 2. Face ID / Biometric Security

- Whispr uses Face ID or Touch ID (when available) to restrict access to your journal entries.
- Your biometric data is handled **entirely by your device‚Äôs secure system (e.g. Apple Face ID)** ‚Äî we do not store or process biometric data.
- In the rare event of a software bug, there may be a risk of unintended access. We work to minimize this, but **you use the app at your own discretion and risk.**

## 3. Analytics (Minimal Usage Data)

To improve the app and understand usage trends, we use **Google Analytics for Firebase**. This includes anonymous data such as:
- App opens
- Feature usage (e.g. when recording starts)
- Device type and OS version
- Length of transcript

**We do NOT collect:**
- Any journal content
- Personal identifiers
- Audio recordings or transcripts

## 4. No Accounts, No Syncing

- Whispr does **not require a login or account**.
- There is **no cloud backup or syncing** ‚Äî your data stays on your device.
- Deleting the app will permanently delete your entries unless you manually back them up.

## 5. Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, we do not store anything identifiable that can be retrieved, edited, or deleted via user request. If you uninstall Whispr, all locally stored data will be removed from your device.
